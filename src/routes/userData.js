    retrospective: `Working on this application has taught me the value of proper planning and writing maintainable code. 
        The nature of creating this project as a learning tool means that I use libraries and methods that I have experience with first, 
        before researching and implementing new techniques and libraries in situ as I learn them. 
        This resulted in inconsistent and fragmented code that is exponentially harder to maintain and refactor 
        as more and more features were added. 
        <br/><br/>
        If I were to start this project over, I would spend more time planning out the structure of the application 
        and researching the necessary tools beforehand. I would also increase the frequency of housekeeping tasks 
        such as refactoring and modularizing code to keep the codebase clean, simple, and maintainable.`,
