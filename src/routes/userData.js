  introduction: `I am a self-taught web developer pivoting from an aircraft engineering background. I have been
      creating full stack, responsive web applications for over a year, with a solid understanding
      of the fundamentals, specializing in the <b>MERN</b> stack, although I do experiment with less common
      and newer technologies such as Svelte and Next.js. I am a quick learner and have an affinity for
      problem solving and enjoy the challenges that comes with it.`,

      retrospective: `
        If I were to start this project over, I would spend more time planning out the structure of the application 
        and researching the necessary tools beforehand. I would also increase the frequency of maintenance tasks 
        such as refactoring and modularizing code to keep the codebase clean, simple, and maintainable. 
        <br/>
        As the project got more complicated features got exponentially harder to implement. 
        This could have been avoided if the code was written with extensibility in mind from the very beginning, 
        instead of doing these tasks while simultaneously implementing and debugging new features.
