const e={introduction:`I am a self-taught web developer pivoting from an aircraft engineering background. I have been
      creating full stack, responsive web applications for a few years, with a solid understanding
      of the fundamentals, specializing in the <b>MERN</b> stack, although I do experiment with newer and legacy 
      technologies such as Svelte, Next.js, and Yii2. I am a quick learner and I enjoy coming up with 
      elegant solutions to challenging problems, and writing clean, concise, and readable code.`,educationHistory:[{institution:"Universiti Kuala Lumpur",title:"Bachelor of Technology - Aircraft Engineering Technology (Honours) in Mechanical",duration:"July 2017 - July 2021",description:["Propeller Noise Reduction Paper - data collection with custom designed 6 sensor testbed and Arduino microcontroller, real time data streamed time over serial connection and recorded to an excel sheet","Graduated with 3.75/4.00 CGPA"]}],jobHistory:[{institution:"CTAPPS MSC Sdn Bhd",title:"Full Stack Developer",duration:"March 2023 - present",description:["Developing full-stack web applications including from start to finish","Implementing backend telephony infrastructures for clients such as Public Bank","Connecting backend telephony systems with easy to use front-end web interfaces"],skills:["javascript","php","mysql","yii2","lua","freeswitch","html","css"]},{institution:"Freelance",title:"Web Developer",duration:"January 2022 - March 2023",description:["Designed, developed, and maintained all aspects of a web application, including the server-side and client-side components","Designed frontend UI with modern frameworks such as React and Svelte","Created databases, RESTful APIs, and integrating third-party tools and services"]},{institution:"Asia AeroTechnic (AAT)",title:"Internship",duration:"January 2021 - July 2021",description:["Provided base maintenance assistance and routine maintenance tasks for commercial aircraft such as the A320, B737, ATR42/72","Assisted in various troubleshoots of mechanical and avionic systems","Prepare and assisted in composite repair of control surfaces","Assisted in Borescope inspection on turbine engines","Took part in Engine preservation and maintenance program for 2 A320 aircraft"]}],additionalSkills:["html","css","javascript","php","lua","sass","git","react","svelte","yii2","node","mongodb","mysql","express","tailwindcss","freeswitch"]},a={personal:{name:"Akmal Shareef",title:"Full Stack Developer",photo:"headshot1.webp"},email:"ved.rgravx@tcatnoc",resume:{filename:"Akmal-Shareef-Resume.pdf",downloadName:"Akmal-Shareef-Resume"},linkedIn:{page:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/xvargr"},github:{username:"xvargr",userAgent:"xvargr.dev",page:"https://github.com/xvargr",excludedRepos:[500291917,607604295],sort:!0},services:{wake:!0,keepAwake:!0,wakeInterval:84e4,maxUptime:18e5,doNotWake:[588034462]},imageQuery:{query:"mountain",size:"medium",per_page:80,page:1,exclude:["Person","Man"]},fallbackColor:{background:"#c29588",highlight:"#f5b9a8",text:"#292929"},formLink:"https://formspree.io/f/mqkopzle",emojis:["ü¶ä","üê∏","üê£","üê≥","üëå","ü§ô","üç´","üç∞","üç™","üçó","üçï","üçî"]},t={imageData:{filename:"bgFallback.jpg",url:"https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-lake-in-mountains-in-winter-12365963/",photographer:"eberhard grossgasteiger",photographer_url:"https://www.pexels.com/@eberhardgross",avg_color:"#1e3641",src:{original:"bgFallback.jpg"},alt:"A Lake in Mountains in Winter",color:{background:"#1e3641",highlight:"#374f5a",text:"#ebebeb"},timeout:7e3},repoData:[{id:515840292,node_id:"R_kgDOHr8ZJA",name:"mercury-messenger",full_name:"xvargr/mercury-messenger",private:!1,html_url:"https://github.com/xvargr/mercury-messenger",description:"Group messaging application inspired by Discord and Slack,  created independently as a learning tool for React and Tailwind",created_at:"2022-07-20T05:04:08Z",updated_at:"2023-02-20T07:57:59Z",pushed_at:"2023-02-22T07:11:02Z",homepage:"https://mercury-messenger.onrender.com",stargazers_count:3,watchers_count:3,language:"JavaScript",forks_count:0,topics:["axios","express","mongodb","node","passport","react","socket-io","tailwindcss"],visibility:"public",forks:0,watchers:3,default_branch:"main"},{id:588034462,node_id:"R_kgDOIwyxng",name:"xvargr.dev",full_name:"xvargr/xvargr.dev",private:!1,html_url:"https://github.com/xvargr/xvargr.dev",description:"Personal portfolio website, fetches latest public github repo data and keeps hosting services awake for seamless visitor access",homepage:"https://xvargr.dev/",stargazers_count:0,watchers_count:0,language:"Svelte",forks_count:0,topics:["sass","svelte"],visibility:"public",forks:0,watchers:0,default_branch:"main"},{id:490190223,node_id:"R_kgDOHTe1jw",name:"pins",full_name:"xvargr/pins",private:!1,html_url:"https://github.com/xvargr/pins",description:"Yelp-like reviews website, tutorial guided project created to learn the basics of front and backend web development",homepage:"https://pins.onrender.com",stargazers_count:0,watchers_count:0,language:"JavaScript",forks_count:0,topics:["ejs","express","mongodb","node","passport"],visibility:"public",forks:0,watchers:0,default_branch:"main"}]};export{e as a,t as f,a as u};
