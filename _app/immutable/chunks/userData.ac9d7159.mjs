        If I were to start this project over, I would spend more time planning out the structure of the application 
        and researching the necessary tools beforehand. I would also increase the frequency of maintenance tasks 
        such as refactoring and modularizing code to keep the codebase clean, simple, and maintainable. 
        <br/>
        As the project got more complicated features got exponentially harder to implement. 
        This could have been avoided if the code was written with extensibility in mind from the very beginning, 
        instead of doing these tasks while simultaneously implementing and debugging new features.
